This package provides a universal transfer learning model, PMTransformer (Porous Materials Transformer), which obtains the state-of-the-art performance in predicting various properties of porous materials. The PMTRansformer was pre-trainied with 1.9 million hypothetical porous materials including Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), Covalent-Organic Frameworks (COFs), Porous Polymer Networks (PPNs), and zeolites. By fine-tuning the pre-trained PMTransformer, you can easily obtain machine learning models to accurately predict various properties of porous materials .
