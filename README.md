This package provides a diffusion model for the generation of pure silica zeolite, ZeoDiff (Zeolite Diffusion), which generated porous materials using a diffusion model for the first time. The model was developed based on the framework of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) with zeolite structures represented as three dimensional grids of energy, silicon, and oxygen channels. Our model successfully generated realistic zeolite structuers while exhibiting a capability of inverse design with user-desired properties.
